# Forecasting-With-SARIMA
Exploring data for multiple campaigns and then building out a forecast using SARIMA technique

Start by importing the data in a daily format. Two campaigns contain data from 2016, another from 2017 and one was fairly new which made it more difficult to build out a forecast using Python since it requires more time periods. Proceeded to explore the data by aggregating the data into weekly and monthly using resmapling method. Will notice that most campaigns were trending downwards. Proceeded to build of SARIMA forecast using the weekly data and then came up with manual calculation to distribute into a daily forecast. Finally, would export and adjust forecasts in Excel manually. 

Campaigns are unnamed for privacy purposes.
